# give_tf_weapon - the custom weapons part

This repo contains an array of custom weapons made for the TF2 [give_tf_weapon](https://github.com/envyniv/give_tf_weapon) Vscript utility.

I've moved these to a separate repo so that those who want to only have `give_tf_weapon`,
and not any custom weapons or unneeded features, may more easily manage their files.

## Weapons included
- all original gtfw custom weapons, by [yakibomb](https://github.com/yakibomb)

## Usage tutorial
**see the** `tutorial` **folder**
